   instead of using the libaria2. This simplify a lot the link process to
   libaria2 on Windows.
    - kiwix-lib doesn't depend on libaria2 anymore.
    - kiwix-lib now depends on libcurl.
 * [API break] Library class API has been updated :
    - Books are referenced by id, not index. A lot of methods have been
      updated this way.
    - Books "list" is now private.
    - There is no more "current" book.
    - listBooksIds's filters have been updated.
 * [API break] Book class API has been updated :
    - Move the definition of Book in `book.h`.
    - Use getter/setter methods instead public members.
    - Size (getSize/setSize) is now returned in bytes, not kB.
    - Dependending of how the book has been initialized (opdsfeed), the
      faviconUrl may be stored in the book, the favicon being downloaded when
      using `getFavicon`.
    - The path (and indexPath) are always absolute path.
    - Book has now a downloadId, corresponding to the aria2 download id (if
      exists)
  * [API break] Manager class API has been updated :
    - The manager is mainly use to fill a Libray from a "library.xml" file or
      opds feed. Other operations (has removeBookById, setBookPath, filter, ...)
      have been removed.
    - The manager use a intermediate class (LibraryManipulator) to add book to
      the library. This dependency injection allow caller code to hook the add
      of a book to the library.
    - The manager work on a existing Library. It doesn't how a internal
      Library.
  * [API break] OpdsDumper class API has been updated :
    - dumpOPDSFeed method now take the list of bookIds to dump instead of
      dumping all books in the library.
    - OpdsDumper can now dump openSearch result information (total result
      count, start index, ...).
  * [API break] Common tools API has been updated :
    - `base64_encode` and `base64_decode` take std::string as arguments.
    - New `download` function in networkTools.h using libcurl.
    - New `getDataDirectory` function in pathTools.
    - Better `beautifyInteger` and `beautifyFileSize` functions.
    - New `nodeToString` function serializing a pugi::xml_node to a string.

      language code.
